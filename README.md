# dropzone-dragpath

This is a simple javascript library that I have previously used to allow users to select metadata values when uploading files via drag and drop.

This implementation relies on dropzone.js (http://www.dropzonejs.com/) and jquery.dragbetter.js (https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter).
